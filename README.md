# Subject  
For this project we had to make our own version or R-Type. But it's not only that...  
We also had to make a network game where one to four players will be able to play together.  
  
### Information
- We used the SFML library for this project.
- We did a whole game engine (ECS) permitting to add multiples graphical libraries thanks to encapsulation.  
- We added a scripting part, with ChaiScript for developpers.
  
# Documentation  
- [SFML documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/)  
- [ChaiScript documentation](https://chaiscript.com/)  
- You can see our project documentation (at html/index.html) and our protocol (in xlsx format) [here](/documentation/).
