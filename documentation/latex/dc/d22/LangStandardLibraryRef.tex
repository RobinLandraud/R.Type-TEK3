Chai\+Script, at its core, has some very functional programming-\/inspired habits. Few places show this off as clearly as the prelude, itself a name taken as a nod to the popular functional language Haskell. This prelude is available to all standard Chai\+Script applications, and provides a simple foundation for using numbers, strings, and ranges (the general category of \mbox{\hyperlink{classChaiScript__Language_1_1Range}{Range}} cs and their iteration).
