This document outlines the principles that drive the development of Chai\+Script. Chai\+Script does not intent to be the perfect tool for {\itshape every} situation, but it does intend to be a good general purpose tool for {\itshape most} situations.\hypertarget{md_ChaiScript_6_1_0_DesignGoals_autotoc_md57}{}\doxysection{Goals}\label{md_ChaiScript_6_1_0_DesignGoals_autotoc_md57}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}

\item 0 external depenencies
\item \char`\"{}\+Perfect\char`\"{} integration with C++
\begin{DoxyItemize}
